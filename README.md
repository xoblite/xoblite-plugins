# xoblite plugins
This repository contains the source code of my plugins for xoblite™ and other Blackbox for Windows® branches.

Matching binary downloads can be found at http://xoblite.net/docs/plugins/.

**=== THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION ===**

Last but not least, like most developers I love getting some (positive) feedback every now and then, so if you
like this plugin *PLEASE* tell me!!! My email address is as follows (change applicable parts of the address):

                       qwilk_AT_xoblite_DOT_net

Please note that due to a severe lack of time, my response time may be in the range "poor" to "infinity",
however I'll try my best to reply to your email(s). Just don't expect too much... :|

Alternatively, you can also tag me on Twitter (@xoblite #xoblite) and perhaps star me here on GitHub. Thanks! =]

Enjoy! :D
