=========================================================================================

xControlRGB-Corsair is a plugin that integrates your Corsair iCUE compatible RGB HW
with the *box experience, by replicating select colours from your current style onto your
physical HW (e.g. keyboard, mouse, mouse pad...) == stepping out of the box, literally! :D

The plugin will automatically use the first non-parentRelative style element in the following order:
toolbar.windowLabel -> toolbar.clock -> toolbar.label ->
-> menu.grip -> menu.active/hilite -> menu.title ->
-> toolbar -> menu.frame.

It will also respond to dynamic style changes triggered by the xoblite Designer Mode,
i.e. it is possible to "paint" colours directly onto both *box elements and the RGB HW... =]

Quick start:
(1) Download the latest release of this plugin from http://xoblite.net/.
(2) Unzip the plugin .zip file to a folder of your choice (e.g. typically a new subfolder within your plugins folder).
(3) Put the included CUE SDK redistributable CUESDK_2013.dll into the same folder as Blackbox.exe
    (alternatively, you can always download the latest CUE SDK from https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk ).
(4) Make sure that "Enable SDK" is enabled in the Corsair iCUE SW settings
    (if you're using an old version, you can always download the latest iCUE version from https://www.corsair.com/icue ).
(5) Load the plugin by regular means, e.g. via the menu or drag'n'drop of the .dll to the Desktop.
Done!

Last but not least, like most developers I love getting some (positive) feedback every now and then, so if you
like this plugin *PLEASE* tell me!!! My email address is as follows (change applicable parts of the address):

Please note that due to a severe lack of time, my response time may be in the range "poor" to "infinity",
however I'll try my best to reply to your email(s). Just don't expect too much... :|

Alternatively, you can also tag me on Twitter (@xoblite #xoblite) and perhaps star me on GitHub. Thanks! =]

Enjoy! :D
